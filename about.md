## Hey, I'm Emilio

I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer based in Bilbao, Spain. I've been working in infrastructure and cloud for 15+ years — from racking servers and managing on-prem systems to automating multi-cloud environments and running Kubernetes in production.

I started out doing everything from networking to sysadmin work. Over time, I leaned into automation, infrastructure as code, and eventually the cloud-native world. These days, I focus on building reliable, scalable platforms and helping teams ship faster with less stress.

## What I Work On

I’ve spent most of my recent years working with:

- **Cloud infrastructure**: AWS, GCP, Terraform, CI/CD, FinOps
- **Kubernetes at scale**: EKS, GKE, Argo CD, GitOps, observability stacks
- **Automation & IaC**: Terraform modules, Ansible, Packer, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring & logging**: Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Mimir, Fluent-bit
- **Security & governance**: IAM, PCI compliance, OPA policies

I’ve also led platform teams, contributed to incident reviews, helped development teams own their infrastructure, and pushed for better practices without becoming dogmatic about it.

## Things I'm Proud Of

- 💸 **Cutting $1M/year in cloud costs** by leading FinOps efforts at StubHub
- 🔄 **Built reusable infrastructure automation** for teams at Clarivate, with Terraform + Jenkins + Backstage
- 🧠 **Set up observability stacks** using LGTM on spot instances to save money and boost visibility
- 🏗️ **Helped migrate legacy platforms to the cloud**, including full infra-as-code deployments

## A Bit More About Me

Outside of work, I enjoy messing with open source tooling, testing out new tech stacks, and occasionally sharing what I learn with teammates. I'm also into Raspberry Pis, small robotics projects, and 3D printing — anything hands-on that scratches the builder itch.

When I’m not in tech mode, I’m usually on my road bike, out for a run, or enjoying time with my family (including a dog and two cats who rule the house).

## Let’s Talk

I’m always open to new challenges or just exchanging ideas. Feel free to reach out if you're working on something interesting — whether it's automation, infrastructure, or building better teams.
