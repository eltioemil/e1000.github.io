## Who I Am

I'm Emilio Ure√±a, a Senior DevOps Engineer based in Leioa, Spain with over 15 years of experience in infrastructure management, cloud technologies, and DevOps practices. I specialize in creating efficient, scalable, and reliable infrastructure solutions using modern cloud-native technologies.

## My Journey

My career began in system administration back in 2008, where I managed IT departments and learned the fundamentals of infrastructure management. Over the years, I've evolved from traditional system administration to embracing the DevOps culture, eventually specializing in cloud technologies and Kubernetes.

My journey has taken me through various roles:
- **IT Manager** at Ferri Villena S.L. (2008-2013)
- **System Administrator/DevOps** at Rentalia Holidays S.L. (2013-2016)
- **DevOps/Cloud Systems Architect** at BBVA Next Technologies (2016-2018)
- **Senior Infrastructure Engineer** at StubHub (2018-2019)
- **Manager/Technical Lead** at StubHub (2019-2020)
- **Senior DevOps Engineer** at Clarivate (2020-2022)
- **Senior Platform Engineer** at BlueLabs (2022-2025)
- **Senior Cloud Architect** at T-Systems Iberia (2025-Present)

## What I Do

I specialize in cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices with expertise in:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, and hybrid cloud solutions
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (EKS, GKE), Docker, and related technologies
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, Packer, Ansible, and automation tools
- **CI/CD & DevOps**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Spinnaker, Argo CD, and GitOps practices
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Mimir, and comprehensive monitoring solutions
- **Security & Compliance**: PCI compliance, IAM, and security best practices

## My Approach

I believe in creating robust, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure solutions. My approach focuses on:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything should be version-controlled and automated
- **GitOps**: Declarative infrastructure management with Git as the single source of truth
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and logging for better system understanding
- **Security First**: Implementing security best practices from the ground up
- **Collaboration**: Working closely with development teams to foster DevOps culture
- **Continuous Improvement**: Always learning and adapting to new technologies and practices

## Key Achievements

Throughout my career, I've achieved several significant milestones:

- **Cost Optimization**: Led FinOps initiatives that reduced cloud expenditure by $1 million annually
- **Reliability Improvement**: Increased system uptime from 97% to 99.9% through automation
- **Cloud Migration**: Successfully migrated legacy on-premise systems to cloud infrastructure
- **Team Leadership**: Promoted to lead DevOps teams and foster collaborative culture
- **Security Compliance**: Ensured PCI compliance for financial services infrastructure

## Beyond Work

When I'm not working on infrastructure and cloud solutions, you can find me:

- Contributing to open source projects
- Learning new technologies and staying current with industry trends
- Sharing knowledge through technical talks and demos
- Pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya
- Exploring new ways to improve infrastructure automation and efficiency
