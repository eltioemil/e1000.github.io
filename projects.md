Here are some of the key projects and initiatives I've worked on throughout my career. Each represents different challenges and learning opportunities in the DevOps and cloud infrastructure space.

## Cloud Infrastructure Automation Platform

**Technologies:** Terraform, Jenkins, Groovy, AWS ECS, Backstage

Developed an automated solution to deploy Terraform infrastructure via Jenkins Pipelines at Clarivate, adhering to the D.R.Y. principle and using a custom Groovy shared library.

**Key Features:**
- Custom Groovy shared library for infrastructure automation
- Jenkins pipeline integration for Terraform deployments
- ECS Fargate application deployment automation
- Backstage integration for company-wide accessibility
- Self-service infrastructure for development teams

**Impact:**
- Empowered development teams to contribute to infrastructure code at their own pace
- Standardized infrastructure deployment processes across the organization
- Reduced manual infrastructure provisioning time by 80%

## Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Platform

**Technologies:** Kubernetes, EKS, GKE, Argo CD, GitOps, Terraform

Designed and implemented a comprehensive Kubernetes platform supporting both AWS EKS and GCP GKE clusters with GitOps workflows.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-cloud Kubernetes orchestration
- Argo CD for GitOps continuous delivery
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
