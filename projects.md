Here are some key initiatives I've worked on throughout my career in DevOps, platform engineering, and cloud infrastructure.

## Self-Service Infrastructure Platform at Clarivate

**Technologies:** AWS, Terraform, Jenkins, Groovy, ECS Fargate, Backstage

Developed a Jenkins-based automation platform with reusable Groovy libraries to deploy Terraform-managed infrastructure and ECS-based applications. Made this accessible across teams via Backstage.

**Impact:**
- Enabled developer self-service for infrastructure and application deployment
- Reduced manual provisioning time by 80%
- Promoted infrastructure-as-code practices across teams

## Kubernetes-Based Platform Operations at BlueLabs

**Technologies:** GCP, GKE, Argo CD, Terraform, Python

Managed multiple GKE environments across GCP organizations using shared VPCs and GitOps workflows with Argo CD. Developed automation in Python for managing spot node lifecycles and internal tooling.

**Impact:**
- Improved scalability and automation in production systems
- Introduced observability and cost-efficiency with LGTM stack on spot nodes
- Contributed to internal platform understanding by building operational tooling

## Observability Stack on Kubernetes

**Technologies:** Loki, Grafana, Mimir, Prometheus, Fluent-bit, Kubernetes

Implemented a complete observability solution with long-term metric storage and centralized logging. Used Fluent-bit for log collection and deployed the stack on spot nodes for cost savings.

**Impact:**
- Boosted debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Cut costs by leveraging spot infrastructure
- Created reusable dashboards and alerting templates for internal use

## Cloud Cost Optimization at StubHub

**Technologies:** AWS, GCP, FinOps, CloudFormation, Terraform

Led a FinOps initiative that achieved over $1 million in annual cloud savings. Helped define a fully automated cloud infrastructure strategy and migrated legacy systems from on-prem to AWS.

**Impact:**
- Reduced cloud costs by 50%
- Improved reliability with 99.9% uptime
- Contributed to PCI-compliant deployments and international platform enablement

## Infrastructure Automation Frameworks

**Technologies:** Terraform, Ansible, Packer, GitHub Actions, OPA

Created reusable Terraform modules, automated pipelines, and governance via Open Policy Agent. Used Packer for image builds and Ansible for OS-level configuration.

**Impact:**
- Streamlined deployment pipelines across multiple companies
- Improved consistency and auditability of infrastructure
- Enforced best practices via policies and automation

## CDN & DNS at Scale with Cloudflare

**Technologies:** Cloudflare, DDoS Protection, SaaS Integrations

Architected and managed over 100 Cloudflare zones using Cloudflare for SaaS. Rolled out global CDN and security protections including DDoS mitigation and centralized DNS management.

**Impact:**
- Improved global site performance and reliability
- Enhanced platform security posture
- Simplified multi-zone management through automation

## Technical Enablement & Team Leadership

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve:

- Led and mentored DevOps teams
- Promoted a DevOps and GitOps culture within product and platform teams
- Conducted internal tech talks and demos on cloud-native tooling
- Participated in postmortem reviews and incident response
- Contributed to architecture and tooling decisions
